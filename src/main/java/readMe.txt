Hello! Brandt here.

These are some coding challenges from coderbyte.com I'm doing to get into the habit of coding every day. I will
start with Java and not worry about integrating these with anything like Maven, Spring, Tomcat or AWS (unless the
challenges call for it). These challenges are for me to get a deeper understanding of the intricacies of Java.
